# Characteristics of a Canonical Geometry

**Canonical geometries should contain all aspects of the workflow so that
through the creation of the geometries one encounters all methods and
considerations necessary to create functional models.**

### First, Basic Model

* Multiple volumes
* Shared surfaces
* Overlaps
* Unnecessary details to be removed (holes/threads)
* Non-solid volumes
* Small Gaps
* Some applicability to real-life models

### Examples of/Ideas for basic models

* Four Boxes with extraneous features such as a liquid volume, holes (threads?)

  - Doesn't have applicability to real-life models
  - Can easily be made to have all other characteristics
  - Easy dimensions will make for easy tutorial and easy geometry to mesh and visually check for errors
  - Can use the trelis/cubit meshing tutorials as direct reference

* Radial model
  - Some applicability, could be a basis to build further complex models
  - Can easily be made to have all other basic characteristics
  - May be made to exemplify curvilinear CAD issues

### Auxiliary, Difficult Models (Further design considerations)

* MELCOR geometry (flows that split and recombine)
* Toroidal geometry with thin walls that may lose particles
* A radial slice where one encounters boundary conditions
